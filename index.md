# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  
My first milestone was setting up the IDE and being able to move the servo motor using potentiometer. ESP32 board, potentiometer, servo motor, breadboard, and jumper wires were used to connect everything together. First, I had to learn how breadboard works - how each row and column is connected, and positives and negatives. After learning how it works, I had to set up Arduino and the IDE to check that both of them works, then test the potentiometer by connecting both to the breadboard. Learning basic things allowed me to start on the project - connecting ESP32 board with the potentiometer and servo motor. I had to becareful with the pin locations or the code won't work. After wiring all parts together, I coded so rotation of potentiometer can also rotate the servo motor in 0 to 180 degrees.
